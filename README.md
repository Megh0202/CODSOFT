This repository contains three simple Python applications:

1. **Rock-Paper-Scissors Game**
2. **Contact Book**
3. **Password Generator**

## 1. Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

### Description:

## 3. Password Generator

### Description:
The Password Generator is a tool that generates strong and random passwords based on user input. The user specifies the desired length of the password, and the program creates a password with a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.

### Features:

- The password includes uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters to ensure security.
- The user can specify the length, and the program will generate the password accordingly.

### How to Use:
1. Run the `password.py` script.
2. Enter the desired password length.
3. The program will generate and display a random password based on the specified length.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- No external libraries are required, as the projects use Python’s built-in modules such as `random`, `string`, and `os`.
